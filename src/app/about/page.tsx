        About me
      </h1>
      <article className="space-y-4 text-lg">
        <p>
          I'm a Software Engineer currently living in{" "}
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santar%C3%A9m,_Par%C3%A1">
            Santarém, Pará
          </a>
          , in the heart of the Brazilian Amazon. I’m passionate about building
          meaningful digital experiences and using technology to solve real-world
          problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the{" "}
          <a href="https://ufpa.br/">Federal University of Pará (UFPA)</a>, where
          I developed a strong foundation in algorithms, systems, and software
          architecture.
        </p>

        <p>
          During college, I had the opportunity to intern in a research group, where I
          began my journey with Java by developing a project called{" "}
          <strong>BioBlu</strong> — an assistive technology app designed to help
          visually impaired students learn classical genetics concepts, especially
          Mendel's Laws. The project was built in collaboration with professors and a
          visually impaired student and was well received as a pedagogical support
          tool.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2021, I worked as a full stack developer intern. While I had the
          opportunity to work on Android apps, most of my work focused on backend
          development. I gained solid experience designing and building RESTful APIs,
          managing databases, and understanding the entire API development lifecycle.
        </p>

        <p>
          Soon after, I joined{" "}
          <a href="https://jeitto.com.br">Jeitto</a>, a Brazilian fintech that serves
          over 2 million users. I started as a Junior Android Developer and was later
          promoted to Mid-Level. I currently work on the Onboarding squad, where I use
          Kotlin to build scalable, high-impact features focused
          on user acquisition and experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm also a big fan of Flutter and have built several apps using it —
          including side projects and freelance work that reached thousands of users.
          I'm always exploring new patterns, architectures, and UI strategies to
          deliver polished mobile experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of development, I enjoy sharing my knowledge through writing on{" "}
          <a href="https://medium.com/@iamageo">Medium</a> and engaging with other
          professionals on{" "}
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/iamageo">LinkedIn</a>.
